# RECREO
## Find Your Next Playtime Location
by browsing playgrounds and parks in your area and finding helpful information about their equipment and amenities.

### Motivation
There are various applications that make it easier to find good hotels or restaurants near you. They display pricing, noise levels, amenities, etc. for adults to find a great spot to work at, stay or dine out. But what about our kids? Imagine you take your kids out for a playdate at a park you found online, but when you're there you realize that the playground equipment isn't safe for your toddlers or not exciting enough for your older kids.

### Project Goals
The goal is to create an app that lets users add playgrounds with images and helpful descriptions for other caretakers. Locations can be rated and commented on.
